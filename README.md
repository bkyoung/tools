# Tools
Here you will find a random assortment of little tools I write that are useful to me

## upgrade_hashi.sh
As the name implies, it can easily install/upgrade all the hashicorp command-line tools with this script:
   ```
   $ ./upgrade_hashi.sh all
   ```

## upgrade_vbox.sh
As the name implies it can look up the latest version of virtualbox and upgrade if there's a newer version available.
   ```
   $ ./upgrade_vbox.sh
   ```
